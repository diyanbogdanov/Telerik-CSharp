NEW YORK ï¿½  King says it will start offering a "French Fry " for a buck, as it looks to fend off McDonald's aggressive push for its Dollar Menu.

 Miami-based chain says the burger will be available Sept. 1 through the fall, as it looks to drum up sales and customer interest with cheap new concoctions.

 burger, which clocks in at 360 calories and 19 grams of fat, is a relatively novel offering, but doesn't require any extra investment from  King; it's basically a standard beef patty topped with four of the chain's french fries.
